## About
My name is Chris Buswinka, I am currently a PhD student in the Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology graduate program at Harvard University. I am currently in the lab of Artur Indzhykulian studying temporary threshold shifts and hair bundles.

## Dumb Ideas

### Adaptation and Creep in Hair Cells
From physics, the tensile strength of materials depend on the rate of force application. You can intuitivly think about this if you try to 'snap' a paper from both ends. It doesnt break! Now think about force probes. Their onsets are often given as an impulse, then sustained. Imagine now, that top connectors act similarly to the paper before. With an initial instant force, they resist movement, limiting deflection, however as force is sustained they relax and can continue to allow the hair bundle to deflect. This is the root cause of the creep seen in force probes.
